2. Management Plan

2.1 Team Organization and Responsibilities

Our team, Group 6, consists of the following people:
Nick Henderson, Wentian Lin, Chris Wycoff, Hongtao Yang, Dennis Zipprich.
We have three sub groups where responsibility is then divided to further 
disperse the workload among team members.

The first subgroup consists of just Dennis Zipprich. This subgroup is
responsible for all managerial processes, documents and logistics. This first
subgroup provides help where needed to ensure the project gets delivered on
time.

The second subgroup consists of Nick Henderson and Chris Wycoff. This
subgroup is in charge of Android app development and database set up and
delivery. This subgroup is responsible for timely development and delivery
of all Android mobile app software modules, the connection of this app to
a database, and a method of downloading the database in the required format. 

The third subgroup consists of Wentian Lin and Hongtao Yang. This subgroup
will be in charge of developing the web app that provides a means for users to
view the data being stored in the database.

2.2 Team Meeting Logistics

Group 6, with everybody present, meets via Zoom meeting two times a week 
on Tuesdays and Thursdays following CIS422 lecture. These meetings consist
of top level progress reports of the project and what issues are currently 
the most pressing for the project and project logistics. Team members are
expected to stay on topic and make efficient use of this time.

Team subgroups also meet outside of the times listed above to ensure
smooth and on-time development of Duck Tracker software modules.


3. Work Breakdown Schedule

This section will outline the work breakdown schedule. This will include
specific items in the critical path and when major milestones are met. This
section will also include any delays in the work process.

4. Monitoring and Reporting

This section is dedicated to monitoring and reporting for progress on project 1.
This section will detail the specific monitoring information completed by the
team manager. This section will also detail specific progress reports made by
team subgroups. The main report outlined in this section is the progress report.

A progress report will consist of progress made since the last progress report,
any obstacles with development of software, potential future troubles, and any
other concerns with regards to the project. Progress reports are conducted by
the team administrator and the applicable team subgroup. The purpose of the
status report is to assess the progress being made by the team member
subgroups and potentially identify any potential work stoppages in the critical path.


5. Build Plan

This project will be broken down into two major builds. The two major builds
will be a beta build of our software system, and a final build. These major
builds will follow the project milestones as closely as possible. Build plan will
follow the Milestone progress status as closely as possible to deliver the project on time.

5.1 Beta Build

Our team selected to go with a beta build due to ease of verifying proper
operation and debugging when necassary. A highly polished beta build would
better resemble a final build for Ducktracker, and would allow our team to
make improvements where we saw fit.

The beta is a near-complete version of our system, one that has little to no bugs
with operation and consistently logs location data in the database. 
This beta build will be primarily used for debugging use of the entire system 
and testing the system for extended periods of time.
This phase will also serve the purpose of identifying areas for improving ease
of use, as necessary.

This will be roughly equivalent to a working copy of Duck Tracker’s entire
working system, and should resmemble as close as possible to a final build.  

5.2 Final Build

The final build features no known bugs, which has been verified by extensive use.
This is the intended end product of our software system, meeting all project
requirements and ready to ship to users and stakeholders.

In this stage, the Android app, database, and web portal are integrated and functioning
properly. A tool is provided as a means of downloading the database in the format
specified by the system requirements. 

The final build was tested on a device that remained plugged in and on for two separate
24-hour periods and recorded measurements in 5-minute intervals with no interruption.
